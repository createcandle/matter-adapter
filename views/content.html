<!-- 
The controller creates a view elemenf for the addon. This addon's Javascript then loads this chunk of HTML into that view.

It's recommended to not manipulate the view container. That's why this HTML starts with making its own content container.

- extension-matter-adapter-content-container is the main container. It's use is mainly to allow everything inside to scroll (through overflow: auto in the CSS)
- - extension-matter-adapter-content holds the content for the addon. It starts with the title, and is then followed by some tabs.

The page has a imaginary border of 10 rem, which is where things like the menu button reside.(Those buttons are themselves 2rem from the side, and 8 rem wide and tall).

Addons may add buttons to the top-right and bottom-right corner. Buttons to add or refresh things are prefered in the bottom-right. Settings or tutorial buttons are prefered in the rop right.
